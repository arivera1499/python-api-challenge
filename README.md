# python-api-challenge

-During this challenge most of the material referenced came from rewatching lectures as well as assistance during office hours. I also received help from fellow peers especially on the linear regression aspects of the assignment and extra comments where included in the code for more clarification

-The final file with code submitted was the finish product of the startcode that was given for us to use. Included in the assignement was the output of the csv file that was created in the first part of the weather portion of the assignment. Since i did not want to run the api multiple times this file was used for the second half of the weather. I also referenced the previous Pandas and module 5 assignment as they were moderately similar at some points.

-chatGPT was used when further explinations or quick definitions where needed for a lot of the pandas and .plt methods that were used during this challenge. GPT was also useful for finding the correct syntax and formating of columns in certain dataframes aswell as for formating the .plt for each graph that was required. Documentation on how to retreive api request was used throughout the assignment as well as previous code for request that we did together in class
